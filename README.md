## Projects & Problem Solving

### üë§ [Salifort Motors HR Attrition ‚Äî Recall-First Retention Modeling](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/salifort-attrition)
Built a recall-first attrition model with XGBoost (vs Random Forest), champion by CV-AP; locked the operating threshold on validation using a highest-œÑ rule to meet a ~0.90 recall target (no test tuning). Deployed œÑ‚âà0.928; test confirms Precision 0.981, Recall 0.899, Accuracy 0.980 at ~15% flag rate. Deliverables: model card, policy PR curve, XGB vs RF confusion matrices, risk tiers, and SHAP explanations.

### üöó [Waze Churn Prediction ‚Äî Operational Threshold Modeling](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/waze-churn-prediction)
Built a recall-first churn model with XGBoost (vs Random Forest), freezing the operating threshold on validation via bootstrap; no test-set tuning. Deployed a 0.575 policy delivering ~52% recall and ~34% precision on test (PR-AUC 0.354, ~2x baseline 0.175) at a 26.7% flag rate; plus a model card, risk tiers, confusion matrix, and F-score feature insights to guide retention.

### üõçÔ∏è [Amazon India Women's Fashion Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/amazon-in-dashboard)
Analyzed 100K+ Q1 FY23 orders across styles, promo usage, and fulfillment status using SQL and Python-based ELT.
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to track AOV shifts, top-selling products, and return/cancellation risk for business stakeholders.

### üåÄ [Hurricane Milton: Airport Resilience Analysis](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/airport-resilience-milton)
Engineered an Airport Resilience Index by integrating 20.4K FAA flight records with NOAA storm data to measure how Florida airports recover from extreme weather.
Built Python + SQL pipelines to model storm-adjusted delays and cancellations, then visualized recovery timelines and resilience scores to support disaster-response planning.

### üìô [LeetCode SQL 50 ‚Äì Solutions & Commentary](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/leetcode-sql-50)
Completed all problems from LeetCode‚Äôs Top 50 SQL Questions using PostgreSQL.
Focused on clean syntax, practical fixes, and detailed inline commentary ‚Äî emphasizing *why* a query works, not just how.
In the final category, I challenge a few accepted solutions where the logic didn‚Äôt hold up in real-world scenarios.
