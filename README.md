## Projects & Problem Solving

### 🚗 [Waze Churn Prediction — Operational Threshold Modeling](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/waze-churn-prediction)
Built a recall-first churn model with XGBoost (benchmarked against Random Forest), with the operating threshold frozen on validation via bootstrap; no test-set tuning. Deployed a 0.575 policy that delivers ~52% recall at ~34% precision on test, AP 0.354 (~2x baseline 0.175), and a 26.7% flag rate; plus validation-derived risk tiers, a model card, confusion matrix, and F-score feature importance to guide retention strategy.

### 🛍️ [Amazon India Women's Fashion Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/amazon-in-dashboard)
Analyzed 100K+ Q1 FY23 orders across styles, promo usage, and fulfillment status using SQL and Python-based ELT.
Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to track AOV shifts, top-selling products, and return/cancellation risk for business stakeholders.

### 🌀 [Hurricane Milton: Airport Resilience Analysis](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/airport-resilience-milton)
Engineered an Airport Resilience Index by integrating 5K+ FAA flight records with NOAA storm data to measure how Florida airports recover from extreme weather.
Built Python + SQL pipelines to model storm-adjusted delays and cancellations, then visualized recovery timelines and resilience scores to support disaster-response planning.

### 📘 [LeetCode SQL 50 – Solutions & Commentary](https://github.com/christopherbolduc/leetcode-sql-50)
Completed all problems from LeetCode’s Top 50 SQL Questions using PostgreSQL.
Focused on clean syntax, practical fixes, and detailed inline commentary — emphasizing *why* a query works, not just how.
In the final category, I challenge a few accepted solutions where the logic didn’t hold up in real-world scenarios.
